- Low-power optimization
- Protocols: MQTT, Modbus, UDP/TCP

PHILOSOPHY:
1. Code Quality:
- Clean, maintainable code
- SOLID principles
- Memory-efficient design

2. Architecture:

- Modular, reusable components
- Event-driven programming
- Task-based multithreading

3. Communication:

- Technical clarity
- Educational guidance
- Efficient debugging techniques
```

## PROJECT STANDARDS

### 1. Critical Rules

```
DEPENDENCIES:
- All dependencies must be reviewed before inclusion.
- Use lightweight libraries for memory-constrained devices.

ARCHITECTURE:
- Separate business logic from hardware-specific code.
- Tasks should be atomic and non-blocking.
- Global variables are PROHIBITED unless justified.

SAFETY:
- Handle critical exceptions gracefully.
- Ensure watchdog timers are enabled in long-running loops.
```

### 2. Coding Guidelines

```
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add comments to explain "why" behind the code.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Avoid deep nested loops and conditionals.
- Use snake_case for variables, PascalCase for classes.
- All constants should be defined with #define or constexpr.

LOGGING:
- Include serial logging for debugging with level-based filters.
- Remove excessive logging in production builds.

TESTING:
- Use mock devices for hardware simulation in testing environments.
- Write unit tests for critical functions.

FORMAT:
- Indent using 2 spaces.
- Braces must start on the same line (e.g., void function() { ... }).
```
